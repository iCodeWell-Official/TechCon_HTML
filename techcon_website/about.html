            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>The Origins and Evolution of TechCon</h3>
            <p>TechCon, one of the most significant annual technology conventions, has grown from a small gathering of industry enthusiasts to a global event that shapes the future of technology. Its journey mirrors the rapid advancements in the tech world, making it an essential platform for innovators, developers, and businesses alike.</p>
            <h3>Origins</h3>
            <p>TechCon's humble beginnings trace back to the early 1990s when a small group of tech developers and engineers gathered to share ideas about the growing potential of personal computers and the Internet. Originally focused on local innovations, the convention was more like a meetup for developers interested in programming languages, operating systems, and early web technologies. It was known as “The Tech Meetup” and held in Silicon Valley, an emerging tech hub at the time.</p>
